             <p>My name is Amanda Cochrane. I am looking to elevate my career from an Integration Specialist to a VBA developer. In the past two years, I have been working for a startup tech company, busybusy. There I have continued mastering my customer service skills and taken it to the next level. I have specialized and taken our integrations to a new level. Now underneath me is a team of 4 and 5 different developers. All of these interactions and work is coordinated by me as well as managing expectations and needs from our clients. As a working mother, I believe in creating a friendly, collaborative, resourceful and inclusive environment that is empowering. Working environments should cultivate a mutual respect and shared success.  I approach challenges with a solution-oriented mindset and love overcoming challenges. 
Customer Service Initiatives
My journey in Customer Service equipped me with the ability to lead teams effectively. I have implemented comprehensive customer service initiatives that focus on delivering exceptional experiences at every touchpoint to make sure customer satisfaction is consistently exceeded. I have learned to leverage data analytics to proactively address customer needs and resolve issues before escalation. This is done by generating continuous feedback loops to refine our customer service processes, ensuring adaptability and alignment with evolving client expectations and business evolution.

Strong Work Ethic
From a young age I was taught what it meant to have a strong work ethic. While this has evolved and gone beyond being reliable and trustworthy, I have made sure to stay curious and continue learning all that I can about the tech world and how it interests me. I believe this also stems from the critical attention to detail that is expected in this field. I constantly chase the excitement that I feel when I accomplish a task that has been my consuming my brain.

Adaptability 
Tech professionals often juggle multiple projects and deadlines. Effective time management and the ability to prioritize tasks are essential for maintaining productivity and meeting deadlines. I pride myself in the flexibility and adjusting myself to each situation, technology and environment to thrive in diverse rolls and projects. Taking responsibility for my work, meeting commitments, and being accountable for outcomes are vital components. 

Problem Solving
One of my strongest attributes is problem solving. Precision is crucial especially in tech. Whether it is writing clean code, managing data, or ensuring security. The meticulous work is overwhelming but one that can be met by being resourceful and continuing to learn more. Challenges and obstacles are commmon tech problems.
